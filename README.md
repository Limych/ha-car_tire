### Configuration Variables

> **_Note_**:\
> This sensor should work with any weather provider in any of it settings. But please note that the sensor cannot see further than the weather provider shows. Therefore, it is recommended to set the `daily` mode in the weather provider settings. If necessary, you can configure a separate weather provider instance especially for this sensor.

**weather:**\
  _(string) (Required)_\
  Weather provider entity ID.

**name:**\
  _(string) (Optional) (Default value: "Snowtire")_\
  Name to use in the frontend.

**days:**\
  _(positive integer) (Optional) (Default value: 7)_\
  The number of days how far forward the sensor looks for the weather forecast.

## Track updates

You can automatically track new versions of this component and update it by [HACS][hacs].

## Troubleshooting

To enable debug logs use this configuration:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.snowtire: debug
```
... then restart HA.
